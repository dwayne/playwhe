What is this?

    A Python API and script for the retrieval and storage of Play Whe results
    from the National Lotteries Control Board (NLCB) [http://www.nlcb.co.tt/].

Why was this written?

    Short answer:
        Because it can be written.

    Slightly longer answer:
        Because I was looking for a small Python project to work on for practice.

Which version do I have?

    Version 0.3.

    After installing the package you can also check the version number by issuing
    the following command at a shell prompt.

    $ playwhe.py --version

How do I install it?

    $ tar xvzf playwhe-0.3.tar.gz
    $ cd playwhe-0.3
    $ sudo python setup.py install

What are some of the things it can do?

    You can get Play Whe results directly from NLCB using the playwhe module.

    > import playwhe
    > p = playwhe.PlayWhe()

    > # retrieve and display all the results for the month of April in the year 2011
    > print "\n\n".join(map(lambda r: r.prettyprint(), p.results_for_month(2011, 4)))

    > # retrieve and display the results for April 2nd, 2011
    > print "\n\n".join(map(lambda r: r.prettyprint(), p.results_for_day(2011, 4, 2)))

    > # retrieve and display the two most recent results
    > print "\n\n".join(map(lambda r: r.prettyprint(), p.results()))

    You can get Play Whe results directly from NLCB using the playwhe.py script.

    $ echo Retrieve and display the results for the month of April in the year 2011
    $ playwhe.py --pretty-print --date=2011-04
    $ playwhe.py -p -d 2011-04

    $ echo Retrieve and display the results for April 2nd, 2011
    $ playwhe.py --pretty-print --date=2011-04-02
    $ playwhe.py -p -d 2011-04-02

    $ echo Retrieve and display the two most recent results
    $ playwhe.py --pretty-print
    $ playwhe.py -p

    You can keep a local copy of previous Play Whe results in an SQLite database.

    $ echo Create and initialize a Play Whe database
    $ playwhe.py --createdb="/home/<username>/playwhe.db"
    $ playwhe.py -c "/home/<username>/playwhe.db"

    $ echo Update the Play Whe database
    $ playwhe.py --updatedb="/home/<username>/playwhe.db"
    $ playwhe.py -u "/home/<username>/playwhe.db"

    $ echo Update the Play Whe database and keep a log
    $ playwhe.py -u "/home/<username>/playwhe.db" 2>> "/home/<username>/playwhe.log"
